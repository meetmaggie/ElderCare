Perfect! Here's the updated prompt for Replit's AI:
Updated Prompt for Emergency Call Feature:
"Make these dashboard buttons functional with these specific features:
1. Schedule Emergency Family Alert:

Create a modal/popup with emergency alert options:

'Alert family now' (immediate call to family members)
'Schedule welfare check call' (within 2 hours)
'Request daily call now' (trigger today's call early)


Include reason dropdown: Health concern mentioned, No response to calls, Family requested check, Concerning conversation
Include urgency level: Low (email alert), Medium (phone call), High (immediate call + SMS)
Add message box for specific details to share with family
Save alert to database alerts table with timestamp and details
Show confirmation: 'Family will be contacted within 5 minutes'

Purpose: This contacts the adult children (bill payers) immediately when there's concern about their elderly parent, NOT emergency services.
2. Update Care Settings:

Create a settings page or modal with forms for:

Preferred daily call times (multiple time slots)
Emergency family contact details (primary, secondary contacts)
Health conditions to monitor specifically
Alert preferences: Email only, Phone calls, SMS + calls
Call frequency options (daily, every other day, weekends too)
Special instructions for AI (topics to focus on, things to avoid)


Save changes to Supabase elderly_users and family_users tables
Show success confirmation with changes summary

3. View Full Care Report:

Create a comprehensive report page showing:

Last 30 days of call summaries with dates/times
Mood trends chart using recharts (happy, content, sad, worried over time)
Health concerns timeline (when mentioned, what was said)
Social activity tracking (family contact, neighbor visits, outings)
Conversation highlights and concerning patterns
Weekly summary comparisons
'Download PDF Report' button (for doctor visits or family meetings)
'Email Report to Family' option


Professional medical-style layout with clear sections
Print-friendly formatting

Technical Details:

Use existing Supabase connection and database tables
Match current dashboard's beautiful styling
Add proper loading states and error handling
Mobile responsive design for families checking on phones
Use modals for quick actions, separate pages for detailed reports

Key Point: This is a family communication and monitoring service, not a medical emergency service. All 'emergency' features contact family members, not emergency services
